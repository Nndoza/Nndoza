# üëã Hello! I'm Lwando Jaku 
A tech-enthusiast with a growing passion for cloud computing and a clear long-term goal of becoming a Senior Solutions Architect. My journey into tech is driven by a fascination with how cloud technologies can transform businesses and solve complex challenges.


## üöÄ About Me
### Background
Coming from a background in sales and customer service, I bring a unique and powerful advantage to the world of cloud architecture. These experiences have honed my strong communication skills and instilled a deep customer-focused mindset. As a Junior Solutions Architect, this means I'm not just building technical solutions; I'm adept at truly understanding user needs, translating complex technical concepts into clear, actionable insights, and ensuring the solutions I help design genuinely deliver value to the client. This bridge between business needs and technical implementation is where I believe I can truly excel.

### AWS re/Start Journey

Recently, I completed the intensive AWS re/Start program, where I built a robust foundation in cloud technologies. Beyond the practical projects showcased here, the program provided me with:
- Comprehensive theoretical knowledge of core AWS services and their interconnections.
- A deep understanding of cloud best practices in areas like security, cost optimization, and operational excellence.
- Essential problem-solving methodologies tailored for cloud environments.
- Crucial professional skills, including teamwork, presentation, and effective technical communication.
  
This holistic experience has equipped me with both the technical acumen and the client-centric approach vital for a successful career in cloud solutions. I am now focused on securing an entry-level cloud position where I can continue to learn, grow, and gain real-world experience, building a solid technical foundation to progress into a Cloud Solutions Architect role.

## üìÇ Projects
A showcase of the hands on projects I completed during the intensive AWS re/Start program. Through these practical exercises, I've built a strong foundation in cloud computing and gained valuable experience in designing, deploying, and managing solutions on Amazon Web Services.

### Project 1: Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App
This project focuses on establishing a robust and highly available database infrastructure on AWS, and then demonstrating seamless interaction with it via a web application. The core objective was to simulate a common three tier application setup, where a web server communicates with a backend database. This hands on exercise provided crucial experience in deploying managed database services, configuring secure network access, and validating application-to-database connectivity.

### Project 2: Working with Amazon EBS
This project delves into the fundamental aspects of Amazon Elastic Block Store, a scalable and high-performance block-storage service for Amazon EC2. The objective was to gain practical experience in the lifecycle management of EBS volumes, from creation and attachment to an EC2 instance, to creating snapshots for data protection and restoring volumes from those snapshots. This hands-on lab provided crucial insights into persistent storage solutions in the AWS Cloud.

### Project 3: Build Your VPC and Launch a Web Server
This project focused on building a customized and secure network infrastructure on AWS using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, and then deploying a web server within this custom network. The core objective was to understand and implement fundamental networking and security concepts in a cloud environment, culminating in the successful launch of a functional web server accessible via the internet. This hands-on exercise provided crucial experience in creating isolated network environments and controlling traffic flow.

### Project 4: Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management
This project provided a comprehensive introduction to AWS IAM, a fundamental service for securely controlling access to AWS resources. The core objective was to explore and apply IAM concepts such as users, user groups, and policies to manage permissions effectively. This hands-on lab simulated a real-world scenario of assigning different levels of access based on job functions, reinforcing the importance of security and access control in the cloud.

### Project 5: Creating Amazon EC2 Instances
This project focused on exploring multiple methods for launching Amazon EC2 instances, a core compute service in AWS. The objective was to gain hands-on experience in deploying EC2 instances using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface, including connecting to them securely. This lab provided practical insights into different deployment strategies and the programmatic control of AWS resources.
