## üìÇ Projects
During my AWS re/Start program, I have successfully completed 3 hands-on projects that have solidified my understanding of cloud concepts and AWS services.

### Project 1: Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App
This project focuses on establishing a robust and highly available database infrastructure on AWS, and then demonstrating seamless interaction with it via a web application. The core objective was to simulate a common three tier application setup, where a web server communicates with a backend database. This hands on exercise provided crucial experience in deploying managed database services, configuring secure network access, and validating application-to-database connectivity.

### Project 2: Working with Amazon EBS
This project delves into the fundamental aspects of Amazon Elastic Block Store, a scalable and high-performance block-storage service for Amazon EC2. The objective was to gain practical experience in the lifecycle management of EBS volumes, from creation and attachment to an EC2 instance, to creating snapshots for data protection and restoring volumes from those snapshots. This hands-on lab provided crucial insights into persistent storage solutions in the AWS Cloud.

### Project 3: Build Your VPC and Launch a Web Server
This project focused on building a customized and secure network infrastructure on AWS using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, and then deploying a web server within this custom network. The core objective was to understand and implement fundamental networking and security concepts in a cloud environment, culminating in the successful launch of a functional web server accessible via the internet. This hands-on exercise provided crucial experience in creating isolated network environments and controlling traffic flow.
